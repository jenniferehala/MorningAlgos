// Given two arrays, determine if one array is a subsequence of the other.
    // Example: [2,3,5,7,9],[2,7,3]

    // What are your assumptions? constraints?
    // will there ever be an empty array or null? could have a base case thats empty
    // What is the maximum size of the given arrays?
    // and will we only ever deal with two arrays? Or will we be dealing with multiple arrays?
    // what are we to do with if the arrays have more than just integers or different data types such as strings
    // will we ever have to deal with arrays of arrays?
    // or objects? - double checks
    // do they have to be sorted?
    // does order matter?
    // there are arrays, subarrays, subsets, subsequences
    // what are you returning? boolean?
    // determine usually is a boolean
    // some can determine yes or no - possible
    // clarifying questions, how big how small
    // constrainst - how big or how small, edge case - what happens if its empty?
    // when you have aarray you always want to validate the array
    // sometimes will be written
    // time complexity, too big

// given an array on ints, find all the non-consecutive integers
    // example : [1,1,2,3,4,7,9]
    // what are you returning?
        // an array of the non-consecutive integers?
        // return an array of the index of the non-consecutive integers
        // could the numbers be negatives?
        // validate your inputs and returns
        // want to make sure your function compiles and returns what they want to see
        // this is how you would make your test cases
        // you would say: im going to be returning an array of index positions, is that okay what im returning there? do you want me return non-consec integers?
        // does the integer start at 0, are they less than 10^5, will it still run?
    // test case
        // the first one im going to make a string...
        // you want start your validations and your test cases as something that will pass and something that will definitely not pass
        // true false kind of return
        // start with [1,2,3,4]
        // one one one
        // should have returns in it
        // if array is empty, just returns nothing, a base case short circuit
